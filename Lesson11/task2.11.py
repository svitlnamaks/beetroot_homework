# Task 2
# Mathematician
# Implement a class Mathematician which is a helper class for doing math operations on lists
# The class doesn't take any attributes and only has methods:
# square_nums (takes a list of integers and returns the list of squares)
# remove_positives (takes a list of integers and returns it without positive numbers
# filter_leaps (takes a list of dates (integers) and removes those that are not 'leap years'


class Mathematician :
    def square_nums(self, num):
        return [n*n for n in num]

    def remove_positives(self, num):
        return [n for n in num if n<0]

    def filter_leaps(self, num):
        return [n for n in num if (n%4==0) and (not ((n%100==0)and (n%400!=0)))]



if __name__ == '__main__':
    m = Mathematician()

    print(m.square_nums([7, 11, 5, 4])) # == [49, 121, 25, 16]

    print(m.remove_positives([26, -11, -8, 13, -90])) #== [-11, -8, -90])

    print(m.filter_leaps([2001, 1884, 1995, 2003, 2020])) #== [1884, 2020])
